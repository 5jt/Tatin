 'ReInstalls all packages (principal ones as well as dependencies) from scratch.'
 ''
 'Takes a folder as argument. If specified, the folder must host a file apl-dependencies.txt.'
 'Instead of an absolute path you might specify a sub folder of an open Cider project.'
 'Then Tatin works out which project to act on: if there is just one it is taken, for multiple'
 'projects the user is questioned. For a relative path the user is always asked for confirmation.'
 ''
 'All installed packages are removed from the folder (except ZIP files) before a new build'
 'list is compiled and used to install the packages from scratch.'
 ''
 'Notes:'
 ' * This does not update any packages but check on -update.'
 ' * Even with -update this won''t update to later major versions, but check on -major.'
 ' * ZIP files are not removed upfront and have therefore a higher priority, meaning that when'
 '   a dependency list refers to a ZIP file then this will always survive.'
 ' * Instead of a folder you may specify [MyUCMDs] as first argument; it will be understood. '
 ''
 'All defined Registries with a priority greater than 0 are scanned for principal packages,'
 'but one can specify a particular Registry as second (optional) argument.'
 'For dependencies, all Registries with a priority greater than 0 are scanned in any case.'

 '-force      Prevents user confirmation and reporting to the session, including establishing'
 '            a project in case no folder was specified.'
 '-dry        Reports what would have been done without actually doing it.'
 '-nobetas    By default betas are included; suppress with -nobetas.'
 '-update     By default ReInstallDependencies does not install later versions.'
 '            You may change this by specifying this flag. '
 '-major      Even with -update specified, the command won''t update to later major versions,'
 '            but by setting this flag you can inforce that.'
 '            You may also specify -update but you don''t have to.'
 '-recursive  Use this to tell the user command that the given folder is not a package folder'
 '            but a folder with multiple installed packages, and that the user command should  '
 '            go through all sub-folders in that folder and detect whether they are package '
 '            folders, and if so, process them one by one. '
