 '                    can enforce the load operation by specifying the -overwrite flag.'
 '-makeHomeRelative  By default the paths returned by TatinVars.GetFullPath2AssetsFolder'
 '                   and TatinVars.HOME are absolute. By specifying this you can enforce them'
 '                   to be relative: only the package folder and its parent are returned,'
