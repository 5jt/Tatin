 ']Tatin.LoadDependencies [<package-folder>] [<parent-namespace>] -overwrite'
 'Loads all packages defined in a file apl-dependencies.txt from a folder with such a file.'
 ''
 'Takes up to two optional arguments:'
 ' [1] A folder into which one or more packages have been installed'
 ' [2] A namespace into which the packages are going to be loaded'
 '     Default is the current namespace except when "folder" is [MyUCMDs] when the default'
 '     is âŽ•SE instead.'
 '     '
 'In case no argument is specified, ]LoadDependencies looks for open Cider projects. If just'
 'one is open, it acts on it. If more than one is open, the user is questioned.'
 'It also works out the installation folder to load from. If just one is defined in the '
 'project config file, that one is taken. If more than one is defined, the user is questioned.'
 ''
 '-overwrite:        By default a package is not loaded if it is already available. '
 '                   You can enforce the load operation by specifying the -overwrite flag.'
 '-makeHomeRelative  By default the paths returned by TatinVars.GetFullPath2AssetsFolder'
 '                   and TatinVars.HOME are absolute. By specifying this you can enforce them'
 '                   to be relative: only the package folder and its parent are returned,'
 '                   but the current directory must then be set accordingly, of course.'
