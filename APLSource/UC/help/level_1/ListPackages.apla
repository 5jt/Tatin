 'Lists all packages in the Registry or install folder specified.'
 ' * If no argument was specified then the principal Tatin Registry will be assumed (https://tatin.dev)'

 ' * If "[*]" is specified then ALL registries are questioned.'

 'It does not matter whether you specify / or \ in a path, or whether it has or has not'
 'a trailing separator: Tatin is taking care of that.'

 'By default all packages are listed. You can influence the output in several ways:'
 '-group={foo}    List only packages with the given group name.'
 '-dependencies   Add the dependencies of all packages'
 '-tags=foo,goo   List only packages carrying the tags "foo" & "goo".'

 'You can also influence the data returned with the following flags:'
 '-date           Add the publishing date to the output, and assume -noaggr.'
 '-project_url    Add the URL to the result.'
 '-noaggr         By default the output is aggregated; -noaggr prevents that.'
 '-dependencies   This adds dependencies to every package, separated by 2 leading spaces.'
 '                When specified -noaggr is set to 1 in order to make sense.'
