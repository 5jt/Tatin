<p>The group <strong>aplteam</strong> is owned by <a href="https://kai-jaeger.de" class="external_link" target="_blank" title="Link to Kai Jaeger`s home page">Kai Jaeger</a>.</p>
<p>It was originally associated with APL Team Ltd, a company I used during my 15-year-stay in the United Kingdom, before Brexit drove me back to Germany.</p>
<p>The company has ceased to exist, but the group continues to be used for <a href="https://dyalog.com" class="external_link" target="_blank" title="Link to Dyalog`s website">Dyalog</a> APL-related projects on GitHub, therefore it is also used as group name for <a href="https://github.com/aplteam/tatin" class="external_link" target="_blank" title="Link to the package manager Tatin on GitHub">Tatin</a> packages.</p>
