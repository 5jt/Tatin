# Tatin Demo

I suggest these topics for a quick demo:

1. Consuming a simple package: single namespace script with no dependencies

   `SMTP` is a candidate.

2. Consuming a not that simple package: single class script with few dependencies

   `MarkAPL` is a candidate

3. Consuming a more complex package with several dependencies and assets and a API

   `Laguntza` is a candidiate

4. Investigate what Tatin established in the workspace
5. Accessing (using) the package
5. Publish a simple package
