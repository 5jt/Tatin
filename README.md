# Tatin - a Package Manager for Dyalog APL

Tatin is a community project. It is available as Open Source under the (pretty relaxed) MIT license.

A Tarte Tatin is a nice way to package APpLe's.

The documentation is available on [Tatin's principal server](https://tatin.dev/v1/documentation "Link to https://tatin.dev/v1/documentation").

## Overview

Tatin consists of three modules:

* `Client` - the client
* `Server` - the Server
* `Registry` - all code that is shared between the client and the server.

Client as well as Server may run under Windows, Linux and Mac-OS.

Tatin requires Dyalog APL 18.0 Unicode or better. It will be part of 19.0.

## Installing and updating the Tatin Client

The document `InstallingTheTatinClient.html` in the `docs/` folder discusses how to install the Tatin client.

## Usage

Once you've installed the Tatin client you have access to <https://tatin.dev>, the principal Tatin server.

The document `FirstStepsWithTatin.html` in the `docs/` folder will get you started.

## Documentation

There are plenty of documents available in the `docs/` folder, discussing different aspects of Tatin. The document `_ReadMe.html` gives an overview about what each of the document is about.

## Tatin Server 

You might find it useful to run your own Tatin server. For example, all packages used within a company could be served by a Tatin Server within your company LAN.

You may also keep a local Registry on your own machine, for example for development work. From a consumer's perspective there is no difference between consuming a package that is coming from a Tatin Server or from a local Registry.

The document `InstallingTheTatinServer.html` in the `docs/` folder discusses how to install the Tatin client.

## Contributing to the code 

There is a document "TatinForContributor.html" available in the `docs/` folder that discusses how one can contribute to the documentation or the code or both.
