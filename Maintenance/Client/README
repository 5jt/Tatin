# Mainteance files for the Tatin client

The folder Maintenance/ in the Tatin installation folder might or might not contain any 
*.aplf files: functions.

Note that this is for the Tatin client: Tatin Servers have their own mechanism for 
modifying packages.

## The idea

When the user command:
]Tatin.Maintenance /path/2/some-packages
is invoked, then such functions are offered for being executed. 
If you select one (or several or all), then these functions are executed.

For that the user command searches recursively in what was specified as the argument for
package config files. If it finds one, then it calls the maintenance functions one after
the other, and feeds them with the package config data as right argument, expecting the 
maintenance function to return this data, possibly modified.

It then writes the data back, and also adds them to the ZIP file.

Note that it does not keep track of whether a function was executed, and on which folders.
That is left to you.

## The name

The name of a maintenance function always follow the same pattern:

* First a date: when was the function introduced
* Second a short description of what the function will do

## Internal structure

Internally any maintenance function is supposed to explain in details what it will do, and 
under which conditions.

When the user command is invoked with the -show flag, then these comments are printed to âŽ•SE.

## Application

This mechanism can be used to...

* inject new properties into package config files
* remove deprecated properties from package config files
* rename properties in package config files

There might be other applications for this, but this list certainly covers the vast majority 
of cases.

## When to use

Release notes will tell you when a maintenance function is introduced, and when and why and
what for to use it.
