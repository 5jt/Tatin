[CONFIG]
AppName             = 'PlodderForTatin'
DisplayRequests     = 0                     ; 1 makes Rumba display every request in a ⎕ED windows. For debugging only of course.

BaseTagPort         = 0                     ; 0 means: do not inject a port number into the HTML meta base tag. If it is non-zero that port IS injected.

; The following entry makes Tatin log to the Windows Event Log
WindowsEventLog     = ¯1                    ; ¯1 = Write Start/Stop/Error events to Windows Event Log in Runtime;   1: write   ; 0=never

[TRAP]
General             = ¯1        ; ¯1: Error trapping in RunTime but not otherwise;   1: Trap;   0: do not trap.   General means "above" Rumba
Rumba               = 1         ; This has an effect only in development. Rumba traps all errors in RunTime in any case.


[APP]                                                  ; Change the following settings according to your needs:

OnStart             = 'OnStart'                        ; Once called when the server starts
;OnHeader           = 'OnHeader'                       ; Especially useful for handling "Expect" with value "100-continue"
OnRequest           = 'OnRequest'                      ; Called in the event of a request. Setting this is mandatory
