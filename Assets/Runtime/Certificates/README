GitHub does not download certificates (files with the extension ".pem"), so when you fork
Tatin the folder Assets/Runtime/Certificates does not contain any certificates.

However, there are two files that are appropriate, they just have ".RemoveMe" appended to
the real filename. By removing that you get two test certificates.
