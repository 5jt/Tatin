## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Maintenance

    ]TATIN.Maintenance [path]

Where `path` is a path to a folder containing one or more packages,
ask me to select functions from the Maintenance Library,
then apply them to the packages.

Invoked with an option, the command displays information only
and leaves the packages untouched.

-----|--------------------------------------------------------
dry  | Show what the command would do.
info | Show more information about the command and its purpose.
show | Show the leading comments of the selected functions.


The `Maintenance/` folder in the Tatin installation folder holds the Maintenance Library:
APLF files for functions that modify Tatin packages.

The command asks you to pick functions to apply from the Maintenance Library,
then searches recursively in the file path for package config files.
When it finds one, it applies the maintenance functions sequentially,
with the package config data as argument,
receiving the same as result, possibly modified,
which it writes back to the package, and also to the ZIP file.


The name of a maintenance function follows a pattern: the date it was introduced,
and a short description of what it does.
Tatin records your use of a maintenance function by appending the extension `.executed` to the APLF file’s name.

Some use cases:

-   inject new properties into package config files
-   remove deprecated properties from package config files
-   rename properties in package config files

Release notes tell you when a maintenance function is introduced,
and when, why, and for what to use it.
