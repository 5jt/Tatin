# Tatin for Contributors

## Scope of this document

If you want to contribute to the [Tatin project on GitHub](https://github.com/aplteam/Tatin) or make adjustments to Tatin for an in-house project, this document will help you.

Tatin is published under the MIT license, so everybody is welcome to contribute to the code. It is not owned by anybody; it is rather a community project.

This document also discusses how to execute the test suite and how to build a new version of Tatin.

Note that this is not an introduction to how to contribute to a project that is hosted on GitHub. If you are not familiar with that then google "contribute to a GitHub project".


## Requirements

To work on Tatin you need at least Dyalog 18.2 Unicode (it will never run in Classic).

You need one of: 

* Windows
* Linux
* Mac OS

AIX is not supported. The PI is not officially supported but it will probably work anyway.

You also need to have Git installed.

While you can develop on any operating system, building a new version is currently only supported on Windows. This restriction is likely to be lifted in a later version.


## Tatin is managed by Cider

Note that Tatin is managed by the [Cider project management tool](https://github.com/aplteam/Cider).
If you are not familiar with Cider you are advised to spend some time playing with it before using it for serious work. 30 minutes should suffice.

Though it is possible making changes or adding code to Tatin without Cider, using Cider makes it significantly easier. Also, the build process requires Cider.

Having said this, you don't neccessarily need to build a new version for creating a pull request, so you might get away without Cider, but using Cider is certainly recommended.


## How to work on Tatin

After downloading/forking Tatin from GitHub and saving it somewhere, say in `C:\Tatin`, you issue the command 

```
]Cider.OpenProject C:\Tatin
``` 

and you are ready to go. 

Note that there is no need to save a workspace or anything: every function, operator, class, interface or namespace script changed in `#.Tatin` will automatically be saved to disk by [Link](https://github.com/dyalog/link).


## Prepare either the Client or the Server

### Introduction

Note that for running the test suite you only need to prepare the client. However, because  you might want to run the test server independently from the test suite, the required preparations for the server is discussed here as well.


### Preparing the client

If you want to run any Tatin client code execute the function

```
#.Tatin.Admin.Initialize_Client
```

### Preparing the server

If you want to run the Tatin Server execute the function

```
#.Tatin.Admin.Initialize_Server
```

Note that you cannot run both the Client and the Server in the same workspace.

GitHub does not allow downloading certificates, therefore you must take action in this respect. Tatin comes with test certificates, and in order to get around the GitHub restriction the certificates have an "additional extension" `.RemoveMe` which needs, well, removing.

Check the folder `TestServer/Server/Assets/Runtime/Certificates`


## Updating Tatin packages used by Tatin

Although Tatin depends on a couple of Tatin packages, it cannot be used to load those packages; the common bootstrap problem.

For that reason, the packages installed in the `packages/` folder a need to be brought into the `APLSource/` folder by other means:

* All packages that are single class or namespace scripts can simply by copied over; an example is the `Tester2` class.
* Packages that consist of an ordinary namespace need to be copied over as a folder; an example is `CommTools`.


## Do your thing

Now that you have a working version of Tatin on your machine, you can start contributing.

If you find parts of this document confusing, outdated, unclear or missing bits and pieces: change it; that might well be your first valuable contribution.

Whether you improved the documentation or fixed a bug or added a feature, at the end of the day you need to create a Pull Request (PR). That will make the people in charge of the Tatin project check your contribution. At the time of writing that is Kai Jaeger, but this might (and eventually will) change in the future of course.

But before you can create a pull request you are supposed to run the tests to make sure that you did not break anything.


## Special case: working on user commands

When you work on user commands, by default the code is executed in `⎕SE` rather than `#`. This also means that changes are not saved automatically by Link. 

This is a major stumble stone, and therefore it was addressed with version 0.106.0: when the Tatin project is opened with Cider the user is asked:

```
Set DEVELOPMENT←1 in ⎕SE._Tatin? 
(Allows executing user command code in # rather than ⎕SE) 
(Y/n) 
```

The variable `⎕SE._Tatin.DEVELOPMENT←1` tells that the user wants to work on Tatin while calling code in `⎕SE`, and therefore Tatin makes sure that the code in `#` is executed rather than `⎕SE`. 

Note that if there is a variable `⎕SE._Tatin.DEVELOPMENT←0` Cider won't ask the question, and code is executed in `⎕SE`, as it is if there is no variable `⎕SE._Tatin.DEVELOPMENT` at all.


## Executing the test suite

If you just want to execute all test cases before pushing your changes to GitHub then you may ask Cider how to do that:

```
      ]Cider.RunTests
#.Tatin.#.Tatin.TestCases.RunTests ⍝ Execute this for running the test suite
```

Executing `RunTests` means that on Windows you will be asked whether a test server should be started. Usually, you will answer with a "Y", Meaning that the test suite will start another instance of Dyalog, and run a test server in that instance for you.

On non-Windows platforms you will be be asked to start another instance of Dyalog, and you will be given a `)Load /path/2/test-server/RunTatinServer.dws` statement that you can copy over into that new instance and run it. This will load and run the server in a temporary directory.

Developers might also run into one of two common scenarios: 

1. During development you might want to execute all tests or just a specific group (or groups) of tests. 

   You are sitting in front of the monitor, and therefore tests can ask you to perform certain tasks, like closing an edit window etc.

   When a test fails then the test framework stops, and the developer can investigate on the spot.

1. You might want to execute the test suite automatically (batch mode), meaning that the tests should not attempt to interact with a user. (That means that test cases that depend on a user won't be executed. Tatin has only a few test cases that fall into this category; more than 95% of the tests are batchable)

   This might be required by an automated build process.

   In this case, any errors are trapped, and you get just either a single line that reports success or failure in the session or `⎕OFF` is executed, either without a code (in case of success) or the return code 123, indicating failure to the calling environment.

   Note that a single failing test case is considered as "failure" of the whole test suite, though the test framework will continue to execute all remaining tests.

We discuss the two different scenarios one after the other.

### Creating a new version

Creating a new version is discussed later in this document, but there are scenarios when you need to create a new version _before_ you execute the test cases.

The reason for this is that one group of test cases executes user commands. If they are affected by anything you've changed then naturally you want the new version to be available in `⎕SE` for execution, but that is only possible if you create a new version first.

For that reason one test checks whether the version number in the workspace and in `⎕SE` do match. If you are confident that this does not matter in your case you may just carry on. 

### Testing while developing

#### Executing all tests

It is recommended to start a fresh APL session and then load the Tatin project into the CLEAR WS before running any test cases.

Use `]Cider.OpenProject` to do this. Once the project has been opened, you can ask Cider how to execute Tatin's test suite by entering:

```
      ]Cider.RunTests
#.Tatin.#.Tatin.TestCases.RunTests ⍝ Execute this for running the test suite
```

Note that by default the test cases use port 5001 for communication between the client and the Test Server that is part of Tatin. Change the INI files for both server and client if that does not work for you.

When you run the test suite you will be asked whether you want to start a Tatin test server locally, and usually, you will answer with a "Yes!". (Windows only, elsewhere you must start the server yourself by starting a new instance of Dyalog and then copying over and executing the `)Load` statement that is provided as part of the client test suite. This means that at the moment you cannot run the test suite automatically --- batch mode --- on non-Windows platforms, a restriction that will soon be lifted.)

### Starting a Tatin test server "manually"

There may be scenarios when you want to start a local Tatin test server yourself. For that execute the following steps:

1. Instantiate Dyalog Unicode 18.2 or later

2. Execute the following two statements:

```
]Cider.OpenProject /path/to/Tatin
#.Tatin.TestCasesServer.RunTests
```

If you change any code at this stage those changes will be written back to disk, so be careful.

The `RunTests` function performs these tasks:

* Change the current directory
* Establish all required references
* Instantiate the `Tester2` class as `T` 
* Start a local Tatin test server if the user confirms (Windows) this or make the user start a test server (other platforms)
* Call the `T.Run` function

  This will run all test cases, including those that communicate with a locally running Tatin test server and the principal Tatin server available at <https://tatin.dev>

#### Quitting tests

There are scenarios where you want to quit the test suite, for example when a test unearthed a severe bug that needs fixing straight away, before executing the remaining tests.

It may be tempting to enter just `)reset`, but that is not how you should do this: you have to make sure that the test suite cleans up after itself. 

The easiest way to achieve this is to execute this statement:

```
      T.QuitTests
```

### Execute the client test suite multiple times in parallel

You might come up with the idea to start the client part of the tests multiple times in parallel to put some pressure on the Tatin Server.

In general this is a good idea, but the client test suite is not suitable for this. For example, the tests that belong to the "Cache" group _must_ be executed one after the other, they rely on each other. Generally, this should be avoided, but here for technical reasons, it's a must. Running this group in parallel contradicts this, and is bound to fail.

#### Executing only particular tests

The `Tester2` test framework is flexible and powerful; for example, you may execute only the tests that focus on the Tatin Client API. The names of those tests are `Test_API_<number>`.

### Why executing only a few tests?

The full test suite is exhaustive. Also, caching is switched off (except when caching is tested of course). For these reasons executing the full test suite takes considerable time. Therefore you might be interested in executing only certain parts of the test suite. 

The tests are grouped, and that is reflected by the names of the test functions. For example, the names `Test_API_001` and `Test_UserCommand_001` clearly state which group they belong to.

If you are not interested in executing only some of the test cases then skip this and carry on with "[Tests as part of an automated build](#)".

Before executing any test case call this function:

```
#.Tatin.TestCases.Prepare
```

This changes the current directory, establishes all required references and instantiates the `Tester2` class as `T`.

You can now list the groups:

```
      T.ListGroups
 Test_API             27   
 Test_Build            1   
 Test_Cache           10   
 Test_CheckVersions    6   
 Test_ClientConfig    19   
 Test_Demo             9   
 Test_HTTP             6   
 Test_InstallAndLoad  24   
 Test_InstallLatest   11   
 Test_ListPkgs        22   
 Test_ListRegistries   1   
 Test_ListTags         6   
 Test_ListVersions     8   
 Test_Load            38   
 Test_LoadBest         4   
 Test_LX               5   
 Test_Misc            19   
 Test_Pack            19   
 Test_PkgCfg           9   
 Test_Publish         15   
 Test_ReInstall        7   
 Test_ScanRegistries   4   
 Test_Server          63   
 Test_Uninstall       15   
 Test_UserCommands    42   
 Test_ZZZ              4   
```

The number tells how many tests a group comprehends, so when you execute this command on your own machine, the numbers and rows will possibly be slightly different.

You can also list all tests, say for the group `ScanRegistries`:

```
      T.ListTestFunctions 'Scan*'
 Test_ScanRegistries_002  Search for a specific package without specifying a Registry...
 Test_ScanRegistries_003  Enforce a Registry scan after defining a non-existing Regis...
 Test_ScanRegistries_004  Enforce a Registry scan after defining a non-existing Regis...
 Test_ScanRegistries_005  Enforce a Registry scan. The first "Registry" returns HTML ...  
```

Notes:

* The wildcard character (`*`) can be used to identify a group
* The first comment line after any header lines is displayed

You may specify `'view'` as the left argument to force the result of that function into a read-only `⎕ED` window.

Let's assume that you want to execute all tests of the group `API`:

```
T.RunThese 'API'
```

Or just the tests 8 and 20 of the group `API`:
 
```
T.RunThese 'API' (8 20)
```

Or run the groups `API` and `Misc`:

```
T.RunThese 'API,Misc'
```

Or run all tests but `UserCommand`:

```
T.RunThese '~UserCommand'
```

Last but not least you may specify a 1 as the left argument: this makes the test framework stop just before any particular test function is executed. This can be handy to hunt down a bug, or any unexpected behaviour.

```
1 T.RunThese 'API'
```

The test framework offers many more options and features, refer to the documentation for exploring them: go to <https://github.com/aplteam/Tester2> (full picture) or execute `]ADOC #.Tatin.Tester2` (reference).


### Tests as part of an automated build

You may wish to execute the tests that do not require a human in front of the monitor as part of an automated build process.
Tatin is prepared for this.

You can start the test suite either from APL or from the command line.

#### Running the test suite from APL

Call this function:

```
#.Tatin.TestCases.RunBatchTests 1
```

The `1` provided as the right argument is just insurance against accidental calls.

When running the test suite with the batch flag set, as `RunBatchTests` does, is fundamentally different in several respects:

* A Tatin server that listens (by default) on port 5001 is started (and is also shut down) by the test suite itself.
* By default all errors are trapped. 

  If you need to track down a bug then you don't want this: in that case, pass a `1` as the left argument: this is treated as "debug" flag.

Of course `RunBatchTests` does not execute any test cases that require a human in front of the monitor, but the number of such tests is small anyway.

`RunBatchTests` checks the command line:

* In case `OFF2=1` was specified on the command line then `⎕OFF` is executed after the last test case got executed.

  If one or more test cases failed then `⎕OFF 123` is executed. That allows the calling environment to check whether the test suite was executed successfully in its entirety or not.

* If `OFF2=1` was not specified a message is printed to the session, indicating success or failure.

Note that `OFF=1` would kind of also work, but it would make Plodder `⎕OFF`, the underlying HTTP server used by Tatin. That might be too early. For example, you cannot get a code coverage report then.

#### Running the test suite from a console or terminal

There are two scripts available in the Tatin root directory:

1. `RunTests.bat` if you want to run the batch tests under Windows

2. `RunTests.sh` if you want to run the batch tests on a non-Windows platform

These are templates: check their contents, you might need to make amendments. 


## How to create a new version

### Overview {#ov1}

Usually, your job is done once you've created a Pull Request (PR). However, here we document what the administrator of the Tatin project on GitHub needs to do once she has accepted at least one PR or finished her work on a branch.

You may ask Cider how to create a new version of Tatin:

```
      ]Cider.Make
#.Tatin.#.Tatin.Admin.Make 0 ⍝ Execute this for creating a new version
```

Syntax:

* The right argument must be a Boolean:
  * `0` means that a human is sitting in front of the monitor and can be asked questions or perform actions
  * `1` means that no human is available; use this in case you want to create a new version automatically, for example from a batch script
* The optional left argument is a Boolean that defaults to `0`, see below for details.

  It would mean that the instances of Dyalog started to create the Client and the Server won't execute the `lx` command line parameter, allowing you to run the code in the Tracer.


Notes:

* The build ID is always bumped when you create a new version.
* The `Make` function will fire up two instances of Dyalog APL, one for creating the client version, one for creating the server version. The optional left argument, if 1,  prevents the interpreter from running the code straight away. 

### The `load` and `lx` command line parameters
Despite the name of the left argument (`noQLX`) it is not associated with `⎕LX`: for this to work the command line parameters `load` and `lx` are invoked, and `-x` is added in case `noQLX` is 1, preventing the interpreter from executing the expression noted as `lx.` 

If this looks unfamiliar to you: the options `lx` and `load` were introduced in 18.0.

The `Make` function performs the following steps:

1. It runs `Tatin.Admin.MakeClient`

1. It compiles the documentation (markdown) to HTML files and distributes the files

1. It runs `#.Tatin.Admin.MakeServer`

If the right argument was a `0` then it will also ask you whether you want to attempt an update for all packages Tatin itself depends on, and it would also ask you whether the new version of the Tatin Client should be copied to the `MyUCMDs/` folder.

In the process, the `Dist/` folder will be recreated from scratch. The `.zip` files in `Dist/` are to be released on GitHub. The `Dist/` folder will not appear on GitHub due to `.gitignore`.

There will be three zip files:

```
Tatin-Client-{major}.{minor}.{patch}.zip
Tatin-Documentation-{major}.{minor}.{patch}.zip
Tatin-Server-{major}.{minor}.{patch}.zip
```

## Creating a document for proofreading

There is a function that creates a single HTML file from all the Tatin markdown documentation. That makes proofreading significantly easier:

```
      htmlFilename←#.Tatin.Admin.CreateProofReadDocument 1
```

Now open that file with the word processor of your choice and use its spell-checking capabilities.
