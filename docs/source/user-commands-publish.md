## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Build package

    ]TATIN.BuildPackage [source] [target]

Where `source` and `target` are paths to folders, write the contents of the former as a ZIP in the latter,
bumping the build number unless the `version` option sets it.

Folder `source` must contain a file `apl-package.json` defining the package.

You can omit `source` and/or `target` if the source is a Cider project.

The command asks you to confirm any assumptions.

---|---
bump=         | Either `patch` or `minor` or `major`: bump that part of the version number, together with any build number. Affects both the package and its config file.
dependencies= | Find dependencies in this subfolder of the project. (Rarely need to specify this: see [Publishing Packages](publish-packages.md).)
projectspace= | Where the package contents are to be installed.
version=      | Set the version number in both the package project and the package to be created.

Note that `bump=` and `version=` are mutually exclusive.

Until version 0.118.0 `projectspace` was `tatinVars`.

Until version 0.117.0 you could set the build number by including it in the version.
Now the build number gets bumped in all cases.

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`BuildPackage`](api.md#build-package)



## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Create package

    ]TATIN.CreatePackage target

Where `target` is a path to a folder, create a new Tatin package in it.

The command is a wrapper for [`]TATIN.PackageConfig -edit`](user-commands.md#package-config).


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Debug

    ]TATIN.Debug [toggle]

Where `toggle` is 0, 1, `on` or `off`, set Debug Mode on or off.

If `toggle` is omitted, report current state.

With Debug Mode on, Tatin leaves application errors untrapped so you can investigate them.
(Error guards in dfns, errors when communicating via TCP/IP and similar errors are still trapped.)


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Delete packages

    ]Tatin.DeletePackages pattern

Where `pattern` is

-   a registry URL or alias, followed by a package ID
-   a path to a folder containing a package (must contain a file `apl-package.json`) specified with the `file://` protocol

delete one or more packages from the registry or folder, including deprecated packages.

If the pattern matches multiple packages, ask which to delete.

Example arguments:

    https:/tatin.dev/grp-foo-1.0.0         ⍝ registry URL, package ID
    [test-tatin]grp-foo-1.0.0              ⍝ registry alias, package ID
    [test-tatin]foo-1.0.0                  ⍝ no group name
    [test-tatin]foo-1                      ⍝ versions of foo with major=1
    [test-tatin]foo                        ⍝ versions of foo
    file:///path/2/Registry/grp-foo-1.0.0  ⍝ local package

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`DeletePackages`](api.md#delete-packages)


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Deprecate package

    ]TATIN.DeprecatePackage pattern[majorversion] comment

Where

-   `pattern` is a registry URL or alias followed by group and package names

-   `majorversion` (optional) is a major version number (omitted, defaults to all major versions)

-   `comment` is text explaining why the package is deprecated (remmeber to delimit with quotes)

asks to confirm the action, then create
(for each major version targeted)
a new minor version with the `deprecated` property set.

------|-------------------------
force | Don’t ask for confirmation. (Useful mainly for tests.)

Example: Deprecate on `[tatin]` all major versions of `grp-foo`:
```
]TATIN.DeprecatePackages [tatin]grp-foo "Use MarkAPL instead"
```

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`DeprecatePackage`](api.md#deprecate-package)


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Get delete policy

    ]TATIN.GetDeletePolicy [reg]

Where (optional) `reg` is

-   a registry URL or alias
-   `*` (all known registries)
-   `?` (list them and ask me to choose)

or if omitted, `[tatin]`,
report the delete policy (`None`, `Any`, or `JustBetas`) of the server/s concerned
and cache the result.

Query a registry for its delete policy just once
and then cache the result.

------|----------------------------------------
check | Ignore the cache: query the server and cache the response.

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`GetDeletePolicy`](api.md#get-delete-policy)


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Publish package

    ]TATIN.PublishPackage [source] [reg]

Where

-   `source` is a path to a package folder, or a ZIP file (typically created by [BuildPackage](#build-package))
-   `reg` is a registry alias or URL, or `?` (ask me which known registry)

publish the package to the registry if specified, otherwise to `[tatin]`.

If `source` is not specified, look for open Cider projects.
If you find one, use it; if multiple, ask me which.

If the registry’s delete policy is `none`, ask me to confirm publication.

The name of the resulting package is extracted from the ZIP file which therefore must conform
to the Tatin rules.

--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------
dependencies= | Find dependencies in this project subfolder. (Rarely need to specify: see [Publish Packages](publish-packages.md).)

## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Usage data

    ]TATIN.UsageData [reg] [ -download [-all] [-folder=] [-unzip] ]

Where `reg` is a registry URL or alias
(if omitted, ask me which)
list the usage files available.

---------|-----------------------------------------------
all      | Select all available.
download | Ask me which usage files to download to a subfolder of my temp folder.
folder=  | Download to this empty folder.
unzip    | Unzip downloaded file/s and delete ZIPs.

!!! detail inline end "Package downloads"

    A package request might be one person taking a quick look,
    or several team members§ deploying the package in multiple projects,
    with all but the first request served from the Tatin client cache.
    No way to know.

    Tatin’s test suite requests packages from both the Principal Registry and the Test server.
    These requests are flagged as part of a test and ignored when the usage data is compiled.


Each month, Tatin saves its request log as a CSV file,
compresses it, makes it available for download as `usage-data-<YYYY>-<MM>.csv`,
and deletes the previous usage file.
For example, in May 2022 it saved `usage-data-2022-04` and deleted `usage-data-2022-03.csv`.

So the filename `usage-data-2022-04` holds requests from 2022-01-01 to 2022-04-30 inclusive.

Each January, Tatin collects the data from last year and saves it in a file `usage-data-<YYYY>.csv`.
It also deletes any files `usage-data-<YYYY>-<MM>`.

For example, in January 2023 it created a file `usage-data-2022`, and deleted all files `usage-data-2022-*`.

:fontawesome-solid-desktop:
A Tatin server [offers a page](https://tatin.dev/v1/usage-data "Link to the principal Tatin server`s Usage Data page") dedicated to the usage data.
The page shows some of the data and provides links for downloading.

:fontawesome-solid-code:
There are no API functions available for retrieving usage data.
