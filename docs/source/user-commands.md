{: .typewriter}

(There are more [user commands for publishing packages](user-commands-publish.md).)

User commands and their options are case-insensitive.
They all have help built in, for example
```
]tatin -?
]tatin -??
]TATIN.CopyRegistry -?
```

!!! warning "Square brackets in the command syntax"

	Square brackets in the command syntaxes shown on this page indicate **optional command arguments**.
	For example, the `BuildPackage` command has syntax

		]TATIN.BuildPackage [source] [target]

	Above, both the `source` and the `target` arguments are optional.


## Command options

Options are further optional arguments to the command.

Specify all the command’s arguments _before_ any options.
Prefix options with dashes, e.g.

	]TATIN.BuildPackage path/to/package path/to/target -bump=minor

Options affect only the current command.
They override settings in the [user settings](user-settings.md) and leave them unchanged.

Each command’s options are tabulated below its definition.


## Search patterns

Case-insensitive search patterns are used to find packages.
(Optional elements are bracketed.)

```
[reg][/][alias@][grp-]name[-maj[.min[.patch]]]
```

------|-----------------------------
reg   | registry alias or URL
alias | local alias for the package (use only for [installing packages](#install-packages) or [loading packages](#lioad-packages))
name  | package name
maj   | major version number
min   | minor version number
patch | patch number


!!! info "Registry scans"

    When scanning registries, Tatin scans all registries listed in the [user settings](user-settings.md) with a priority above 0.

---

## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Cache

    ]TATIN.Cache [reg]

Where (optional) `reg` is a registry alias or URL, list Tatin package cache contents (domain names and package names) for `reg` if specified, otherwise for all known registries.

------|---
clear | List cached packages, ask for confirmation, then remove them.
force | With `clear`, skips confirmation. (Useful for tests.)
path  | Return full package paths.

```
      ]TATIN.cache '[tatin]'
  --- Entries in cache for tatin.dev/:
   aplteam-ADOC-7.1.2
   aplteam-GitHubAPIv3-1.4.0
   aplteam-CommTools-1.8.1
   ...
```

[`ClearCache`](api.md#clear-cache),
[`ListCache`](api.md#list-cache)

## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Check for later version

    ]TATIN.CheckForLaterVersion folder

Where `folder` is the path to a package folder (contains a `apl-buildlist.json` file),
scan known registries
and list later **minor** versions of principal packages.
(List different major versions as different packages.)

Prints a table with columns:

---|---
1  | currently installed package ID
2  | package ID of the latest version found, or message, e.g. "no response" or "not found"
3  | URL of the original source registry
4  | `!` for a later version
5  | URL of registry with a different (usually later) version; might be empty

Reports registries not scanned because their priority is 0.

-------------|------------------------------
dependencies | Include dependencies
major        | Include later major versions

To update to latest minor version use [`]Tatin.ReInstallDependencies`](#reinstall-dependencies).
(New major versions need installing.)


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Documentation

    ]TATIN.Documentation

Open Tatin documentation in a browser window.


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Find dependencies

    ]TATIN.FindDependencies pkgs [sources]

Where

-   `pkgs` is a comma-delimited list of package IDs (minor and patch numbers are ignored)
-   `sources` is a registry URL or alias (`[*]` for all known), or a path to a folder;
    (optional: defaults to current folder)

scan the source/s recursively for folders wih `apl-dependencies.txt` files and list results.

```
      ]TATIN.FindDependencies MarkAPL [*]
  https://tatin.dev/
                       aplteam-ADOC-7.0.0
                       aplteam-ADOC-7.0.1
                       aplteam-ADOC-7.1.0
                       ...
```

--------|----------
verbose | Report the actual package folder(s) rather than the hosting folder.

<!-- FIXME All I see listed is full package IDs -->

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`FindDependencies`](api.md#find-dependencies)


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Init

    ]TATIN.Init [config]

Where (optional) `config` is a path to a folder containing a `tatin-client.json` file,
(re)set my user settings in `⎕SE`.

If `config` is omitted, use the default user-settings file.

Useful to apply in the session user settings that have changed on file.



## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Install packages

    ]TATIN.InstallPackages pkgs [target]

Where

-   `pkgs` is a comma-separated list: each item identifies a package as one of

    -   a [search pattern](#search-patterns) (optionally including a package alias)
    -   `file://{path/to/folder}` or `file://{path/to/ZIP}`
<!--    -   URL  FIXME Really? Or is this a registry URL in a search pattern? -->

-   `target` (optional) is

    -   path to target folder
    -   `[MyUCMDs]name` or `[MyUCMDs]` (case insensitive)
    -   a Cider project alias

create the target folder if necessary, and
install there the package/s and any dependencies,
registering any package aliases specified.

??? tip "A local alias for a package allows you to use different versions of it in parallel."

    Don't use this for other purposes.

If `target` is `[MyUCMDs]` or `[MyUCMDs]name` install in `⎕SE`.
If `name` is omitted, use the package name,
but signal an error if more than one user-command package is specified after `[MyUCMDs]`.
<!-- FIXME Clarify error condition -->

If `target` is omitted, look for open Cider projects:
if one is found, install in it; if multiple, ask me which.

When installing into a Cider project,
if its `dependencies` and `dependencies_dev` properties identify one folder,
install there; if multiple, ask me which.

If a search pattern does not specify a registry, scan known registries
and use the first hit.
(For dependencies, always scan.)

--------|---------------------
nobetas | Ignore beta versions.


??? example "Example arguments to InstallPackages"

    ```
    [tatin]/group-name-1.0.0 /path       ⍝ reg alias & package ID with "/"
    [tatin]group-name-1.0.0 /path        ⍝ reg alias & package ID without "/"

    A@name /path                         ⍝ just a package name with a pkg alias
    file:///path/grp-name-1.0.0/ /path/  ⍝ package in a local Registry
    foo,bar /install/                    ⍝ multiple packages
    foo [MyUCMDs]                        ⍝ install user command foo
    foo [MyUCMDs]test                    ⍝ install user command foo into test/
    ```

```

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`ListLicences`](api.md#list-licences)


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: List packages

    ]TATIN.ListPackages [source]

Where `source` is

-   a registry URL or alias
-   `[*]` for known registries (or `?` – ask me which)
-   path to a registry
-   path to an install folder

list the packages there, aggregated by major version.

If `source` is omitted, use `[tatin]`.

If `source` is an install folder, ignore command options
and show just package names, with a flag for principal packages.

---|----
group=       | list only packages in this group
dependencies | show all dependencies, assume `-noaggr`
tags=        | (comma-separated list) list only packages so tagged
uc           | list only packages that are user commands

since=       | (YYYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD) ignore packages published earlier (implies `-date` and assumes `-noaggr`)
date         | show publishing date and assume `-noaggr`
project_url  | show the URL
noaggr       | don’t aggregate

!!! tip "Both / or \ work as path separators and trailing separators are optional."

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`ListPackages`](api.md#list-packages)



## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: List registries

    ]TATIN.ListRegistries

List alias, URL, ID, port, priority and no-caching flag of known registries
in descending order of priority.

If a registry does not respond, ask me: retry, skip, or cancel the command.

-----|------------------
full | Show API keys too.
raw  | Show the raw data.

See also [`]TATIN.UserSettings`](#user-settings).

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`ListRegistries`](api.md#list-registries)



## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: List tags

    ]TATIN.ListTags [source]

Where `source` (default `[tatin]`) is

-   a registry alias or URL
-   `?` (ask me which)

list alphabetically all tags used in all packages there.

---|---
tags= | (comma-separated list) show only tags on packages that have all the listed tags
os=   | (comma-separated list: `lin`, `mac` and `win`) show only tags on packages restricted to these operating systems

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`ListTags`](api.md#list-tags)



## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: List versions

    ]TATIN.ListVersions pattern

Where `pattern` is a [search pattern](#search-pattern), list all versions of the package.

If the registry is specified as `?` or `[?]`, ask me to choose one.

If no registry is specified, show registry URLs.

If version precedence is not clear from the version numbers (e.g. for beta versions)
take publication dates into account.

-----|-----------------------
date | Show publication dates.

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`ListVersions`](api.md#list-versions)



## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Load dependencies

    ]TATIN.LoadDependencies [source] [ns]

Where

-  `source` is the source: a folder, into which one or more packages have been installed,
    or `[MyUCMDs]` (case insensitive)
-  `ns` is the target namespace

recursively search the source folder for packages listed in `apl-dependencies.txt`
and load them into the target namespace unless already there.

If `ns` is omitted, the target namespace is the current namespace –
unless `source` is `[MyUCMDs]`, when it is `⎕SE.`

If no arguments are specified, look for open Cider projects.
If one is open, use it; if multiple, ask which.
If the Cider project config defines multiple installation folders, ask which to use.

-----------------|----------------------------------------------------
makeHomeRelative | Instead of absolute paths, make `TatinVars.GetFullPath2AssetsFolder` and `TatinVars.HOME` return only the package folder and its parent.
overwrite        | Overwrite existing packages in the target namespace.

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`LoadDependencies`](api.md#load-dependencies)



## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Load packages

    ]TATIN.LoadPackages pkgs [ns]

Where

-   `pkgs` is a comma-separated list: each item identifies a package as one of

    -   a [search pattern](#search-patterns) (optionally including a package alias)
    -   `file://{path/to/folder}` or `file://{path/to/ZIP}`

-   `ns` is the target namespace (defaults to the current namespace)

load the package/s and all dependencies into the target,
register any aliases specified in `pkgs`,
and show the number of packages loaded, including dependencies.

??? tip "A local alias for a package allows you to use different versions of it in parallel."

    Don't use this for other purposes.

If a search pattern does not specify a registry, scan known registries
and use the first hit.
(For dependencies, always scan.)


--------|----------------------
nobetas | Ignore beta versions.
verbose | Report details.


!!! example "Example arguments to LoadPackages"

    ```

    [company]foo,[personal]bar      ⍝ multiple packages from specific servers
    ```

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`LoadPackages`](api.md#load-packages)


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Load Tatin

    ]TATIN.LoadTatin

Load the Tatin client into `⎕SE` (resulting in `⎕SE.Tatin`), and initialize it.
Write a user config file my home folder if none there.

!!! tip "You can use [`Init`](#init) to temporarily switch to a different config."

----------|--------------------------------
force     | Overwrite existing installation.
permanent | Make any changes permanent. <!-- FIXME Changes to what? -->

!!! detail "Makes the Tatin API available."


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Maintenance

    ]TATIN.Maintenance [path]

Where `path` is a path to a folder containing one or more packages,
ask me to select functions from the Maintenance Library,
then apply them to the packages.

Invoked with an option, the command displays information only
and leaves the packages untouched.

-----|--------------------------------------------------------
dry  | Show what the command would do.
info | Show more information about the command and its purpose.
show | Show the leading comments of the selected functions.

??? detail "More detail…"

    The `Maintenance/` folder in the Tatin installation folder holds the Maintenance Library:
    APLF files for functions that modify Tatin packages.

    (Tatin servers have their own mechanism for updating packages.)

    The command asks you to pick functions to apply from the Maintenance Library,
    then searches recursively in the file path for package config files.
    When it finds one, it applies the maintenance functions sequentially,
    with the package config data as argument,
    receiving the same as result, possibly modified,
    which it writes back to the package, and also to the ZIP file.

    Tatin does not record your use of the maintenance functions.

    The name of a maintenance function follows a pattern: the date it was introduced,
    and a short description of what it does

    Some use cases:

    -   inject new properties into package config files
    -   remove deprecated properties from package config files
    -   rename properties in package config files

    Release notes tell you when a maintenance function is introduced,
    and when, why, and for what to use it.


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Package config

    ]TATIN.PackageConfig [source]

Where `source` is

-    a [search pattern](#search-patterns), ignore any command options, fetch and show the package config file
-    a path to a package folder, show its config file `apl-package.json`, creating it if necessary

If `source` is omitted,

1.  look for open Cider projects: if one is found, use it; if multiple, ask me which.
1.  look for a package config file in the current directory and confirm with me if found.

---|---
edit   | Let me edit the config (since version 0.104.0 Tatin updates the workspace with the new config).
delete | Delete the config.



## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Package dependencies

    ]TATIN.PackageDependencies [path]

Where `path` is the path to a folder containing a package,
display the content of its `apl-dependencies.txt` file,
creating one if necessary.

If `path` is omitted, look for open Cider projects:
if one is open, use it; if multiple, ask me which.

-------|--------------------------------------------
edit   | Let me edit the file.
delete | Delete the dependencies file.
force  | Don’t ask me for confirmations (useful for test cases).


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Ping

    ]TATIN.Ping [source]

Where `source` is

-   a registry or registries, ping it/them and show me which respond;
-   a folder, show whether it exists.

Specify a registry as a registry URL or alias, or `?`.

If `source` is

-   omitted, ping all known registries
-   `?` ask me to choose registries

```
      ]TATIN.Ping
Questioning 2 Tatin Registries...
 https://tatin.dev/       1
 https://test.tatin.dev/  1
      ]TATIN.Ping /Users/sjt/tmp/Foo/packages
Questioning 1 Tatin Registry...
1
```

??? example "Examples"

        ]Tatin.Ping
        ]Tatin.Ping ?
        ]Tatin.Ping [tatin]
        ]Tatin.Ping https://tatin.dev
        ]Tatin.Ping http://tatin.dev   ⍝ This won't work

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`Ping`](api.md#ping)



## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Re-install dependencies

    ]TATIN.ReInstallDependencies [folder] [reg]

Where

-   `folder` is the path to a package folder
-   `reg` is a registry URL or alias

remove from the folder all packages listed in `apl-dependencies.txt` (except ZIP files),
compile a new build list, and use it to re/install the dependencies.

!!! tip "ZIP files have priority and are not removed."

If `folder` is a relative path,
or unspecified, <!-- FIXME Confirm -->
look for a subfolder of an open Cider project:
if one Cider project is open, use it; if multiple, ask me which.
Either way, ask me to confirm the folder.

If `reg` is not specified, scan known registries for the direct dependencies,
but scan known registries anyway for further dependencies.

--------|---------------------------------
dry     | Show what the command would do, but don’t do it.
force   | Skip confirmations (useful for tests).
nobetas | Ignore beta versions.
update  | Install the latest version of each dependency.

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`ReinstallDependencies`](api.md#reinstall-dependencies)


## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Uninstall packages

    1. ]TATIN.UnInstallPackages package folder
    2. ]TATIN.UnInstallPackages package
    3. ]TATIN.UnInstallPackages folder -cleanup
    4. ]TATIN.UnInstallPackages ?

Where

---|---
package | <ul markdown><li>fully qualified name of a package</li><li>alias and fully qualified name of a package</li><li markdown>just a package alias (postfix with a `@` to mark it as alias)</li><li>package ID as group and name</li></ul>
folder | <ul markdown><li>path to a folder with installed packages</li><li markdown>`[MyUCMDs]` (case independent)</li><li>a Cider alias in square brackets</li></ul>

uninstall, according to syntax,

1.  `package` from `folder`
2.  `package` from the currently open Cider project (if several open, ask me which)
3.  from `folder` all superflous packages; i.e. neither top-level nor dependency; e.g. outdated versions
4.  the top-level packages I select from your prompt, and any dependencies thus superfluous

If `folder` is a relative path, it must be a subfolder of an open Cider project.

--------|----------------------
cleanup | See syntax (3) above.
quiet   | Don’t report progress.

:fontawesome-solid-code: API:
[`UninstallPackages`](api.md#uninstall-packages)



## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Update Tatin

    ]TATIN.UpdateTatin

If a later version of Tatin is available,
download it from GitHub,
install it into the folder it was started from,
and display the release notes in a browser window.

!!! warning "Does not update the current workspace"

    To use the updated version, close the current session
    and start a new one.

In Dyalog 19.0 and later
the command replaces the version installed in your home folder, 
not the shipped version, which remains unchanged.


> Debugging is the process of removing bugs from code, while programming is how you introduce them in the first place.

??? tip "Troubleshooting"

    If the update fails, calling it again rarely helps.

    === "Dyalog 19.0+"

        1. `]DeActivate tatin` to remove Tatin
        2. `]Activate tatin` restores the version your installation was shipped with
        3. `]Tatin.UpdateTatin` to update to the latest version

    === "Dyalog 18.2"

        Uninstall Tatin then install it again.

??? detail "Tatin versions before 0.105.0"

    <!-- Can we drop this section yet? -->

    Versions before 0.105.0 might have been installed into one of these folders:

    ```
    C:\Users\<user>\Documents\MyUCMDs\     ⍝ Windows
    /users/<user>/MyUCMDs/                 ⍝ Mac-OS
    /home/<user>/MyUCMDs/                  ⍝ Linux
    ```

    If so, remove the folder `Tatin` from the `MyUCMDs/` folder and install Tatin (and, if installed, Cider) from scratch rather than updating it.

    If you loaded Tatin into `⎕SE` with a script `setup.dyalog` you might need to amend it.



## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: User settings

    ]TATIN.UserSettings

Print my user settings from the config file in JSON format,
hiding the API key.

!!! tip "To see current user settings rather than the file content, use the API.""

--------|-------------------------------------------------------
edit    | Let me edit the file then ask me whether to refresh current settings.
home    | Show path to the config file and do nothing else.
refresh | Refresh the current user settings from the config file.

## :fontawesome-solid-terminal: Version

    ]TATIN.Version

Show the client’s Tatin version.

    ]TATIN.Version reg

Where `reg` is a registry URL or alias (if `?` ask me which) show the Tatin version installed there.

    ]TATIN.Version -all
    ]TATIN.Version *

Show the Tatin versions of the client and known registries.

    ]TATIN.Version -check

Show the installed and minimum required versions of the Principal Registry.
