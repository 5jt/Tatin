# User commands

Every user command comes with at least two levels of help, and a few even with a third level:

1. `-?` shows a brief description and the syntax
2. `-??` shows a detailed description of the command and its arguments and options
3. `-???` shows examples (only available for some commands)

If the third level is available then `-??` shows this at the bottom:

```
]{user-command} -??? ⍝ Enter this for examples                                        
```

!!! tip "Unlike the API, Tatin’s user commands are not case sensitive."
