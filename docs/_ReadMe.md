## Documentation Center

The Tatin documentation consists of a collection of HTML files.

This document gives you an overview over these HTML files: their purpose and who should (or may) read them, and which ones you can savely ignore depending on your skills and goal(s).


### General information

* [Introduction](./Introduction.html) (draft)

  A must-read for _everybody_.

* [Semantic Versioning](./SemanticVersioning.html "SemanticVersioning.html") (draft)

  Read this if you don't know what Semantic Versioning is; an understanding is essential for using Tatin.

* [Tatins Load and Update Strategy](./TatinsLoadAndUpdateStrategy.html "TatinsLoadAndUpdateStrategy.html") (draft)

  You might get away without reading this for quite a while, but when one day you need to understand what Tatin does when there is conflict between dependencies, this is it.

* [Tatin User Settings](./TatinUserSettings.html "TatinUserSettings.html") (draft)

  You need to read this _only_ in case one or more of the following is true for you:
  
  * You are unhappy with Tatin's default location for the user settings file
  * You need multiple user settings files
  * You need one user settings file for multiple users

### The Client

* [Installing and updating the Tatin Client](./InstallingAndUpdatingTheTatinClient.html "InstallingAndUpdatingTheTatinClient.html") (draft)

  Check whether autocomplete in the Dyalog session offers you something after entering `]TATIN` - if that's the case Tatin is already available, so no need for installing a new version.

  However, you might still want to update Tatin.

* [First Steps with Tatin](./FirstStepsWithTatin.html "FirstStepsWithTatin.html") (draft)

  Read this before you consume your first package

* [PackageConfiguration](./PackageConfiguration.html "Regarding Package Configuration") (draft)

  Read this for discussing the details of package configuration files.

* [PublishingPackages](./PublishingPackages.html "PublishingPackages.html") (draft)

  Read this in case you want to publish Tatin packages.


### The Server

* [Installing the Tatin Server](./InstallingTheTatinServer.html "InstallingTheTatinServer.html") (draft)

* [Maintaining the Server](./ServerMaintenance.html "ServerMaintenance.html") (draft)


### Misc

* [Tatin for Contributors](./TatinForContributors.html "TatinForContributors.html") (draft)

  Read this in case you want to contribute to Tatin's documentation and/or Tatin's code.

* [Run Dyalog behind Apache](./RunDyalogBehindApache.html "RunDyalogBehindApache.html") (draft)

  Read this if you want to run a Tatin server behind an Appache server.
