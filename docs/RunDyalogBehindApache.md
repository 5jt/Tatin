# Run Dyalog behind Apache

With Dyalog's Conga, [Rumba](https://github.com/aplteam/RumbaLean "Link to the project on GitHub") or [Plodder ](https://github.com/aplteam/Plodder  "Link to the project on GitHub") you might well decide to serve HTTP requests with an application written in Dyalog  APL.

However, if your application serves requests from the Internet (as opposed to an Intranet), it is strongly recommended to hide your application behind an industrial-strength web server like Apache.

This comes not only with benefits in terms of security, and stronger defences against something like DDOS attacks, it also offers an easy way to implement load balancing.

Apache can be used this way because it can act as a reverse proxy server, sometimes called a gateway server. 

Let's assume that your application is listening on port 8081.

You need to add the following lines to the configuration file for your specific website:

```
ProxyPreserveHost on
ProxyPass / http://localhost:8081/
ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8081/
```

This file is typically found in `/etc/apache2/sites-available`.

In `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` there should be just a link pointing to `/etc/apache2/sites-available`.

The `ProxyPass` directive is doing the magic.

The `ProxyPassReverse` directive ensures that the `Location:` headers generated from the backend (your Tatin Server) are modified to point to the reverse proxy instead of itself.

For details see the ["Reverse Proxy Guide"](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/reverse_proxy.html "Link to the Apache documentation") and [Apache Module mod_proxy](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html "Link to the Apache documentation")
